# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple Java-based TicTacToe game where two players can play against each other. Players take turns to place their marks ('X' or 'O') on a 3x3 grid. The game checks for win conditions across rows, columns, and diagonals after each move. Includes input validation to prevent invalid moves.
